# Assembling Your Octolamp Kit at Universe '25

Your Octolamp kit includes all the components you need to assemble your very own Octolamp! Follow these step-by-step instructions to get your lamp up and running.

Powered by an [Adafruit Sparkle Motion Mini](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6314) microcontroller, your Octolamp features an LED strip that is smarter than it may first appear.

## What is Included
- White inner part
- Black outer cover
- Black base
- White reflector
- Screwdriver
- Microcontroller
- USB cable
- LED cable
- LED strip

## Step 1: Connect the LED Cable to the Microcontroller
1. Use the screwdriver to loosen the first, third, and fourth terminals on the microcontroller.
2. From left to right, insert the red, green, and white wires of the LED cable into the respective terminals.
3. Tighten the terminals using the screwdriver.

## Step 2: Test the LED Connection
1. **Important:** Uncoil the LED strip completely. Powering LEDs while tightly coiled will cause overheating.
2. Connect the LED cable to the LED strip. The cable should connect to the end with arrows pointing **away** from the connector.
3. Plug the USB cable into the microcontroller and connect to a power supply.
4. Most LEDs should light up bright green. The last few LEDs remaining off is normal.
5. If your LEDs do not turn on, check your connections.
6. If you are still having trouble, ask for help!

## Step 3: Install the LED Strip Around the Outer Ring
1. Peel off the beginning of the LED strip's adhesive backing.
2. Press the start of the LED strip against the inside wall of the outer ring, at the base of Mona.
3. Continue around the inside wall of the outer ring, peeling off backing as you go.
4. Firmly press the strip against the ring frequently to ensure good adhesion.
5. Trim the backing paper if it gets in your way.
6. When you complete the outer ring, you should be back where you started at the base of Mona.

## Step 4: Complete the LED Installation
1. Continue the LED strip along the inner ring wall, staying inside the part.
2. Follow the perimeter around the bottom of the ring and around Mona, finishing at her tentacle.
3. Cut off the excess LED strip where the installation is complete.
4. Connect the USB cable to the microcontroller and power supply.
5. All LEDs should now be bright green.
6. If LEDs do not turn on, check your connections.
7. If you are still having trouble, ask for help!

## Step 5: Final Assembly
1. Thread the wires through the slot in the white reflector, aligning Mona's tentacle with the corresponding features.
2. Flip the assembly over and insert the microcontroller into the center cavity of the black base.
3. Feed the USB cable through the hole in the base and connect it to the microcontroller.
4. Snap the black cover into place over the microcontroller.
5. Align the white reflector and inner parts with the black base, gently pressing everything together until fully seated.

## Step 6: Final Test
1. Plug the USB cable into a power supply.
2. Your lamp should be fully illuminated with bright green light.
3. If LEDs do not turn on, check your connections.
4. If you are still having trouble, ask for help!

## Step 7: Clean Up
1. Tidy your workspace, returning tools and disposing of LED strip trimmings.
2. Pack your completed lamp back into its bag.
3. Go explore what the rest of Universe has to offer!

When you get home, connect to the `WLED-AP` WiFi access point the lamp is broadcasting (password: `wled1234`) to customize its colors & behavior. Learn more about what’s possible at https://kno.wled.ge/ - there's Home-Assistant integration & more!
